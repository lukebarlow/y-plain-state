<p>This is a second rewrite of of the <a href="http://y-js.org/#!/examples">Yjs jigsaw 
example</a> using the y-plain-state proxy objects, this time re-implementing the
UI in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.</p>
<p>Although this might not seem like a simplification of the original example,
since there are more files involved, the way the functionality is divided up
means that this might be a good pattern for larger more complex applications.
Each react component is almost entirely self contained, and makes its own
modifications to the state when it changes (which are synchronised automatically).
</p>
<p>
Besides the use of React, the other main change is that every pixel of movement
is transmitted to other clients. This makes it more responsive, but leads to
slightly jerky movement on the receiving client.
</p>

Again, you can inspect and modify the state directly with commands such as

<pre>
JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)
</pre>
and
<pre>
state.piece2.translation.x += 40
</pre>
